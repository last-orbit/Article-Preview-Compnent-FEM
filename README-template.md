## Overview

## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

*A huge takeaway I got from this project was how important it is to do mobile-first workflow instead of desktop-first workflow. I built this with desktop-first workflow and it was not pleasant to scale it down to a mobile state as I had alot of styling issue trying to make it the finished project. Had I gone with doing mobile first, I do believe there would have been more lines of code but it would have been less of a headache with finishing the project.

*This was my second standalone project working with DOM manipulation/Javascript, so having the share button work accurately was a challenge. I was trying to use the .add/.remove method to make the button work correctly, however I could not make it happen correctly. I instead switched to using the .toggle method to make the button functionality work.
